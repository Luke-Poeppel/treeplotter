# `treeplotter`
I wasn't a huge fan of any of the available methods for tree plotting in Python. This package aims to make this easier. It wraps the TreantJS library to plot the trees and save them to a rendered HTML file. This HTML file can then be optionally exported as a high-res PNG by wrapping Rs webshot package.
